## Twitter Web App clone

This is a twitter web app clone built using Next.js with typescript.

The app uses MySQL for the database with passwordless Google Sign-In.

The database in deployed on PlanetScale.

To avoid writing boilerplate SQL statements. I used the Prisma ORM to 
query the database 

The app is still a work in progress so not all features are done
